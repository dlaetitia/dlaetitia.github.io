## Study Overview
- We used in situ imaging data from the Underwater Vision Profiler 5 (UVP5) to predict global zooplankton biomass distribution.
- The study covered a 10-year period (2008-2018) and analyzed 466,872 images from 3,549 stations worldwide.
- Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs) were used to model the relationship between zooplankton biomass and environmental variables.

## Key Findings
1. **Global Biomass Estimate**: The total zooplankton biomass in the upper 500m of the ocean was estimated at 0.403 Pg with an estimated 0.229 PgC for the epipelagic layer (0-200 m) and 0.173 PgC for the mesopelagic layer (200-500 m).

2. **Dominant Groups**:
   - Copepoda: 35.7% of total biomass
   - Eumalacostraca: 26.6%
   - Rhizaria: 16.4%

3. **Spatial Distribution**:
   - Highest biomass values were found around 60°N and 55°S.
   - Lowest biomass was predicted in oceanic gyres and the Arctic (north of 80°N).
   - An increase in biomass was observed around the equator.

## Implications
- This study provides a new method for estimating global zooplankton biomass using in situ imaging and machine learning.
- The findings emphasize the importance of using non-intrusive sampling methods to accurately assess the biomass of fragile organisms like Rhizaria which has been underestimated in previous net-based studies.
- The results can be valuable for improving global biogeochemical models and understanding the role of zooplankton in marine ecosystems and the carbon cycle.

## Perspectives
- Continued use of imaging systems like UVP5 and UVP6 to expand the dataset and improve predictions.
- Focus on sampling underrepresented areas, particularly in polar regions during winter.
- Integration of data from multiple imaging systems to cover a wider size spectrum of zooplankton.
