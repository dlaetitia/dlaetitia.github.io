## About this illustration 

This illustration was created as a graphical abstract for Dr. Anais Lebrun's PhD defense on [Responses of shallow-water Arctic benthic communities to climate change](http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-510653). 

Disclaimer: I did not illustrate the benthic organisms in this illustration. They had been previously used in the PhD manuscript, and we kept them for this illustration to keep a cohesive visual approach.

## Chapter images

To help with the visual cohesiveness, we created circular images that she used throughout her oral presentation for the different chapters.
