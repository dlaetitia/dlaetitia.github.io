    "text": "Study Overview\n\nWe used in situ imaging data from the Underwater Vision Profiler 5 (UVP5) to predict global zooplankton biomass distribution.\nThe study covered a 10-year period (2008-2018) and analyzed 466,872 images from 3,549 stations worldwide.\nBoosted Regression Trees (BRTs) were used to model the relationship between zooplankton biomass and environmental variables."

    "text": "Key Findings\n\nGlobal Biomass Estimate: The total zooplankton biomass in the upper 500m of the ocean was estimated at 0.403 Pg with an estimated 0.229 PgC for the epipelagic layer (0-200 m) and 0.173 PgC for the mesopelagic layer (200-500 m).\n\n\n\nDistribution map of the predicted minimum global biomass between 0 and 500m (Figure 11 of the paper).\n\n\nDominant Groups:\n\nCopepoda: 35.7% of total biomass\nEumalacostraca: 26.6%\nRhizaria: 16.4%\n\nSpatial Distribution:\n\nHighest biomass values were found around 60°N and 55°S.\nLowest biomass was predicted in oceanic gyres and the Arctic (north of 80°N).\nAn increase in biomass was observed around the equator."

    "text": "Implications\n\nThis study provides a new method for estimating global zooplankton biomass using in situ imaging and machine learning.\nThe findings emphasize the importance of using non-intrusive sampling methods to accurately assess the biomass of fragile organisms like Rhizaria which has been underestimated in previous net-based studies.\nThe results can be valuable for improving global biogeochemical models and understanding the role of zooplankton in marine ecosystems and the carbon cycle."

Two sessions were done at the school with all the classes. The first one was done in January 2025 with exercises sheets designed for this project and focused on coloring and counting. The second session in May 2025 was done using news exercise sheets around counting. A board game was specifically designed for this project, using 3D printed organisms. Bonus coloring sheets were distributed.\n\n \n\nOther illustrations were done to illustrate these processes:"

These in situ imaging system were designed to detect, measure and quantify the distribution of zooplankton organisms and marine particles. The images captured by these instruments are then saved on the Ecotaxa platform and through a software called Zooprocess, we have access to 42 morphological descriptors such as size, transparency, complexity, ect.

You can watch her regional performance in this video.\nHere is a presentation of her work and context for this illustration.\nManon is a PhD student in ecotoxicology at the University of Le Havre Normandy and conducts her research at the SEBIO laboratory. She studies the effects of benzophenone-3 (BP-3), a UV filter commonly used in sunscreens, on the lipid metabolism of the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Her objective is to better understand the mechanisms of action of this pollutant on fish physiology and to evaluate the risks it poses to marine ecosystems. For Manon, participating in the “My Thesis in 180 Seconds” competition is an opportunity to share her research with the general public and raise awareness about the impact of emerging pollutants on aquatic ecosystems.

All transect samples were processed by the same experienced taxonomist to ensure consistency across the 13-year period.\nZooplankton data (2010–2023): 650 samples digitized using the ZooScan imaging system, yielding 655,930 individual organism images. These were automatically classified and then validated by expert annotators, resulting in 103 taxonomic and morphological groups with both abundance and biovolume measurements.\nEnvironmental parameters: Temperature and salinity measured at surface and bottom depths across all sampling sites, providing context for interpreting biological patterns.\nSampling design: Two coastal-to-offshore transects (northern transect B with 7 stations, southern transect D with 6 stations) plus three coastal stations (Molène, Sein, Douarnenez). Seasonal sampling increased from three to four times yearly starting in 2017.\n\n\nExamples of planktonic organisms imaged by the ZooScan for the 20 most abundant taxa (Figure 3 of the paper)."

No consistent coastal-to-offshore gradient was evident when data were temporally averaged, likely because the seasonal Ushant thermal front’s spatial effects are obscured by seasonal averaging.\nZooplankton patterns: Clear coastal-to-offshore gradients with decreasing abundances seaward. Coastal stations (especially B1 and D1) consistently showed highest concentrations, reaching up to 8 × 10³ individuals m⁻³. Copepods and Branchiopods dominated coastal waters, while Mollusca showed inverse gradients with higher offshore proportions. Overall, community structure remained relatively stable across the 13-year period."

While other French coastal monitoring programs exist (SOMLIT, REPHY, PELGAS), none provide comparable spatial and temporal coverage of both plankton groups simultaneously within a protected marine area.\nThe data are particularly valuable because they combine traditional microscopy (phytoplankton) with modern imaging technology (zooplankton), demonstrating how complementary approaches can be integrated and shared. This is especially important given recent findings of declining small pelagic fish body sizes across French waters—understanding their primary food resource (plankton) is essential for fisheries management and ecosystem conservation."
