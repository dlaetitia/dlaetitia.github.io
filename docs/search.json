    "text": "Key Findings\n\nGlobal Biomass Estimate: The total zooplankton biomass in the upper 500m of the ocean was estimated at 0.403 Pg with an estimated 0.229 PgC for the epipelagic layer (0-200 m) and 0.173 PgC for the mesopelagic layer (200-500 m).\nDominant Groups:\n\nCopepoda: 35.7% of total biomass\nEumalacostraca: 26.6%\nRhizaria: 16.4%\n\nSpatial Distribution:\n\nHighest biomass values were found around 60°N and 55°S.\nLowest biomass was predicted in oceanic gyres and the Arctic (north of 80°N).\nAn increase in biomass was observed around the equator."

    "text": "Implications\n\nThis study provides a new method for estimating global zooplankton biomass using in situ imaging and machine learning.\nThe findings emphasize the importance of using non-intrusive sampling methods to accurately assess the biomass of fragile organisms like Rhizaria which has been underestimated in previous net-based studies.\nThe results can be valuable for improving global biogeochemical models and understanding the role of zooplankton in marine ecosystems and the carbon cycle."

    "section": "About this illustration",
    "text": "About this illustration\nThis illustration was created as a visual support for Manon Lefèvre, a PhD student (and very good friend) who participated in the french academic competition “My Thesis in 180 Seconds” where PhD students present their thesis in a very short 3 minutes. You can watch her regional performance in this video.\nHere is a presentation of her work and context for this illustration.\nManon is a PhD student in ecotoxicology at the University of Le Havre Normandy and conducts her research at the SEBIO laboratory. She studies the effects of benzophenone-3 (BP-3), a UV filter commonly used in sunscreens, on the lipid metabolism of the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Her objective is to better understand the mechanisms of action of this pollutant on fish physiology and to evaluate the risks it poses to marine ecosystems. For Manon, participating in the “My Thesis in 180 Seconds” competition is an opportunity to share her research with the general public and raise awareness about the impact of emerging pollutants on aquatic ecosystems.

Its more recent version (UVP6) is on the middle right of the figure. The images captured by these instruments are then saved on the Ecotaxa platform and through a software called Zooprocess, we have access to 42 morphological descriptors such as size, transparency, complexity, ect.\nHere are some images examples from the UVP5 dataset:\n\n\n\n\nExample of plankton images"
