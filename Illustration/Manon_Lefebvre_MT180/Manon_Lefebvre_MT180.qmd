## About this illustration 

This illustration was created as a visual support for Manon Lefèvre, a PhD student (and very good friend) who participated in the french academic competition "My Thesis in 180 Seconds" where PhD students present their thesis in a very short 3 minutes. You can watch her regional performance in   [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqcuKgNEeU4){target="_blank"}.

Manon is a PhD student in ecotoxicology at the University of Le Havre Normandy and conducts her research at the SEBIO laboratory.
She studies the effects of benzophenone-3 (BP-3), a UV filter commonly used in sunscreens, on the lipid metabolism of the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Her objective is to better understand the mechanisms of action of this pollutant on fish physiology and to evaluate the risks it poses to marine ecosystems.
For Manon, participating in the "My Thesis in 180 Seconds" competition is an opportunity to share her research with the general public and raise awareness about the impact of emerging pollutants on aquatic ecosystems.
