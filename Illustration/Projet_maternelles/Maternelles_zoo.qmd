## About this illustration 

This illustration was done in the context of a project called "Forms and colors of plankton" built in collaboration with Sakina-Dorothée Ayata, Associate Professor at Sorbonne University and at LOCEAN (Laboratory of Oceanography and Climate), and holder of a scientific mediation chair at the French University Institute.

This project was done in partnership with the Parisian Porte Dorée Tropical Aquarium, the Paris Academy and the Patay kindergarten school. Zooplanktonic organisms will be used in a presentation in May 2025 about the marine food chain starting with phytoplankton and ending with large marine mammals and fish.

Other illustrations were done to illustrate these processes:
