## About this illustration 

This illustration was done in the context of a project called "Forms and colors of plankton" built in collaboration with Sakina-Dorothée Ayata, Associate Professor at Sorbonne University and at LOCEAN (Laboratory of Oceanography and Climate), and holder of a scientific mediation chair at the French University Institute.

This project was done in partnership with the Parisian Porte Dorée Tropical Aquarium, the Paris Academy and the Patay kindergarten school. Children were given a presentation about planktonic organisms as well as multiple exercises to work on forms and colors using phytoplanktonic organisms as examples for square, triangle, circle and rectangle.
