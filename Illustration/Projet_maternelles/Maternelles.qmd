## About this illustration 

This illustration was done in the context of a project called "Forms and colors of plankton" built in collaboration with Sakina-Dorothée Ayata, Associate Professor at Sorbonne University and at LOCEAN (Laboratory of Oceanography and Climate), and holder of a scientific mediation chair at the French University Institute.

This project was done in partnership with the Parisian Porte Dorée Tropical Aquarium, the Paris Academy and the Patay kindergarten school. Two sessions were done at the school with all the classes.
The first one was done in January 2025 with exercises sheets designed for this project and focused on coloring and counting. The second session in May 2025 was done using news exercise sheets around counting. A board game was specifically designed for this project, using 3D printed organisms. Bonus coloring sheets were distributed.
