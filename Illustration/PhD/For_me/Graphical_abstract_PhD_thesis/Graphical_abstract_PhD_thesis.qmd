## About this illustration 

This illustration was created as a graphical abstract for my PhD Thesis [Image-based global analysis of the biological carbon pump](https://theses.fr/2023SORUS562){target="_blank"}.

The images of aggregates, zooplankton organisms and fecal pellets were taken from the Underwater Vision Profiler 5 dataset.
