This press release presented the scientific paper [Century-scale carbon sequestration  
flux throughout the ocean by the biological pump](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01318-9){target="_blank"} published in September 2022 by Ricour et al. We based this illustration on the first figure of the article.
