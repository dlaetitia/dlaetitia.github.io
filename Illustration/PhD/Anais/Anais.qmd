## About this illustration 

This illustration was created as a graphical abstract for Dr. Anais Lebrun's PhD defense on [Responses of shallow-water Arctic benthic communities to climate change](https://theses.fr/2023SORUS479){target="_blank"}. 

Disclaimer: I did not illustrate the benthic organisms in this illustration. They had been previously used in the PhD manuscript, and we kept them for this illustration to keep a cohesive visual approach.

## Chapter images

To help with the visual cohesiveness, we created circular images that she used throughout her oral presentation for the different chapters.
