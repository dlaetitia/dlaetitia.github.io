## About this illustration 

These silhouettes of zooplanktonic organisms were done for personal presentations and used by other scientists for their own presentations. 
On the top left is the silhouette of a Cavolinia (Gastropoda). The other two organisms are copepods with the top one being an Oithona and the lower one a Calanoida.
