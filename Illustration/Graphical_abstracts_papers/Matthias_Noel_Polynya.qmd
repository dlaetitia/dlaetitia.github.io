## About this illustration 

This illustration was created as the graphical abstract for the research article [Atmospheric Response to Antarctic Coastal Polynyas](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2025JD043319){target="_blank"} published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres by Matthias Noël and colleagues at LOCEAN-IPSL (Sorbonne Université, Paris). The paper investigates the atmospheric response to Antarctic coastal polynyas using high-resolution atmospheric modeling.

The schematic illustrates the key atmospheric processes triggered by the opening of a coastal polynya in Antarctica.
